% Copy and paste this section of the code into an m-file called initPatterns.m 
% that will load in the training patterns and test patterns. 
% The input training patterns represent input from 28 users for our 12 movies.  
% Each row below is one training pattern consisting of one user’s ratings, but in the
% last line we transpose the matrix  so that now each column is one training pattern.
% The final element of each training pattern is a ‘1’ representing the bias units’ output.
